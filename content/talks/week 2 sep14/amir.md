__Title:__Analyze of multimodality of gene expression profiles using publically available databases
</br>
</br>
__Abstract:__With increasing the number of RNA-Seq profiles for cancer patients, having a molecular model that can determine samples with overexpression signature based on RNA-Seq data can be helpful for diagnosing early-stage cancers. This model can perform on genes with multimodality distributions. On the other hand, a gene expression can have a multimodality distribution which can drive from a variety of technical, molecular, and biological artifacts including a different study population, batch effect,  sequencing center, analyzing pipeline, race, Methylation, copy number of alteration, etc. Understanding these factors can help the overexpression call model to be more robust. In this work, we show how can we perform such a task on 25,000 samples from TCGA, and GTEx database using Kallisto pipeline.
