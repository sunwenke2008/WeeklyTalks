__Title:__ Characterization of New Brca1 Mutation dependent Tumor Model (Maybe?)
</br>
</br>
__Abstract:__ Individuals that carry a mutation in tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 (BRCA1+/mut) , are predisposed to 60% increase in breast cancer compared to noncarriers. While diagnostics have greatly improved early detection, the earliest events that drive tumorigenesis are widely unknown. Our aim is to develop an in vivo BRCA1 loss dependent endogenous breast tumor model and determine the genetic changes that the breast cells undergo during their progression towards cancer. By using single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology, we are investigating early cell state / cell population changes at different time points during tumorigenesis.
