# Computational Science Group

&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computational Science is concerned with the construction of mathematical models to solve problems in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. This is accomplished through the design and implementation of numerical, probabilistic and statistical models, machine learning and theoretical computer science. The methods and applications are necessarily cross disciplinary. A typical example is the use of topological data analysis - which has roots in algebraic topology in pure mathematics - to analyze protein data or large data clouds. Other examples include environmental modeling via image processing, risk management and forecasting in finance via stochastic simulations, which in turn can be used in computational biology to understand the roles of non-coding RNA in cancer. <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Computational Sciences PhD Program at UMass Boston coordinates and promotes multidisciplinary exchange of ideas
among researchers and graduate students. The program involves
faculty and graduate students in various departments at the College
of Sciences and Mathematics. Departments currently participating in
the program include: Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science,
Engineering, Physics and Mathematics. The program is built on the
existing strong scientific collaborations among faculty and industry
partners. Graduates from the program are expected to be competitive
for securing positions in academia or at companies seeking expertise
in data analytics and high-end implementation of computational modeling.
