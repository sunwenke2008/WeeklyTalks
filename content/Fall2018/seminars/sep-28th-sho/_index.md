__Abstract:__ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful method to detect informative feature directions from the data. However, the linearity of its algorithm has limitations in its performance. The cited paper introduces an application using a kernelization method, which is well known as a technique of Support Vector Machine, to overcome some of the limitations. Here, this presentation briefly summarizes concepts and mathematical backgrounds of PCA and a kernelization method, tries to explain a derivation of the kernel PCA algorithm, and suggest possible future works with using mathematical techniques of this paper.
