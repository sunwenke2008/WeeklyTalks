__Title:__ Multi-label Linear Discriminant Analysis
</br>
</br>
__Abstract:__ Multi-label problems arise frequently in image and video annotations. Linear discriminant analysis is a well-known classification method for dimension reduction. However, LDA only works for single-label multi-class classification because of the ambiguity caused by data with multiple labels. The ambiguity is how to measure the inter and intra class scatters clearly. In this presentation, I going to introduce a new method called Multi-label linear discriminant analysis. This method reformulated the scatter matrices of the original LDA to solve the computation ambiguity problems and incorporates label correlations from multi-label data.
