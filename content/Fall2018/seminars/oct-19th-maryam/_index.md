__Title:__ Effect of SNPs in cis-regulatory motifs on penetrance of pathogenic mutations
</br>
</br>
__Abstract:__ Genome variability has been the focus of many studies in recent years due to its relevance to
the differential disease risk among individuals. Computational models that predict phenotype
from genotype are key for understanding disease related genomic variants and the most
effective therapy for a disease. Recently, rare coding variants are studied mainly by exome
sequencing for rare disease, while common regulatory variant analysis has focused on
application in genome wide association studies of common disease. The generalized models of
joint effect of the regulatory variants with coding variants has been analyzed and represented
in one of the recent researches. This study has worked to analysis how cis-regulatory variation
modifies the penetrance of pathogenic coding variants in their target gene. Analyzing diverse
data types from population and disease cohorts (GTEx and TCGA) along with experimental
approaches has showed that regulatory variants in cis can affect the penetrance of pathogenic
coding variants. In general population, purifying selection is acting on joint regulatory and
coding variants haplotypes. Also, analysis of disease cohorts presents regulatory modifiers of
penetrance affects disease risk. Generally, the joint effects of regulatory and coding variants are
an important part of the genetic architecture of human traits and contribute to modified
penetrance of disease-causing variants.
