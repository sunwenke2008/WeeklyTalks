__Title:__ Sampling algorithms related to determinantal processes
</br>

</br>
</br>
__Abstract:__ Schur processes are measures on sequences of partitions. They have been used to analyze various combinatorial and probilisitc models. I will present a perfect sampling algorithm for Schur processes from a joint work with Betea et al.

Schur processes belong to a class of determinantal processes. I will touch upon machine learning applications of determinantal process from the work of Kulesza and Taskar and present a sampling algorithm due to Hough et al.
