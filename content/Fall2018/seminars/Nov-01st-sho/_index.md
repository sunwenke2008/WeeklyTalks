__Title:__ Sparse Covariance Estimation with the Graphical Lasso
</br>
</br>

</br>
</br>
__Abstract:__ A covariance matrix is used for various machine learning algorithm. However, the sample covariance matrix has large variance with the small number of samples. The Graphical Lasso is a method to estimate a better covariance matrix from sparse data and to generate a sparse graphical model from noisy data. In this talk, I introduce the basic ideas of graphical models and its application “Gaussian graphical model”. Then, explain the algorithm of the Graphical Lasso and a simulation using the Graphical Lasso. In the simulation, Kullback Liebler divergence is used to estimate the optimal penalty parameter.
