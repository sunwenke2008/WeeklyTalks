__Title:__ Computational approaches to identifying transcription factors involved in lytic cycle of Toxoplasma Gondii virulence traits
</br>
</br>
__Abstract:__ Virulence of the parasite Toxoplasma Gondii depends on multiple factors that are packed to specific organelles. Although virulence factor expression is tightly regulated, the molecular mechanism controlling their regulation has been poorly understood. In this project we are taking the advantage of several computational approaches to study the regulators of such virulence, specifically, the Transcription Factors involved in lytic cycle of toxoplasma Gondii virulence traits.
