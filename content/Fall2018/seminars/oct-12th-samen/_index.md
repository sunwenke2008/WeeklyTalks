__Title:__ Analysis of nonâ€“small cell lung cancer histopathology images using deep learning
</br>
</br>
__Abstract:__ Visual analysis of histopathology slides of lung cell tissues is one of the main methods used by pathologists to assess the stage, types and sub-types of lung cancers. Adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are two most prevalent sub-types of lung cancer, but their distinction can be challenging and time-consuming even for the expert eye. In this study, we trained a deep learning model on histopathology images obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to accurately classify whole-slide pathology images into adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma or normal lung tissue.
